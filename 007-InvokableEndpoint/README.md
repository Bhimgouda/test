### Note

They can be thought of as the external endpoint to the logic with most of their primary capabilities being wrapped in functions

Mutating endpoints - Mutates the state-variables and are denoted with "!" at the end of the endpoint name

like this Set!()

Non-Mutating endpoints - Mutate the state-variables and don't have "!" at the end of the endpoint name

like this Get()

"endpoint invokable" is the keyword to declare invokable endpoints & can only be called externally once the logic is deployed on-chain
