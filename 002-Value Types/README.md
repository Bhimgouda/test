# Value Types

Here are some Primitive data types available in cocolang.

1. Bool
2. String
3. Bytes
4. Address
5. U64 and U256
6. I64 and I256

All the coco variables when declared with a particular type are initialized with zero/default values

When they are used as function arguments or variable assignments, their values are copied over to the new variable.

## Tasks

Create a persisitent state variables

1. Create a persistent state variable of type Bool called justABoolean and initialize it to true

2. Create a persistent state variable of type String called justAString and initialize it to "I am a string"

3. Create a persistent state variable of type I64 called Bit64Integer and initialize it to -20

4. Create a persistent state variable of type I256 called Bit256Integer and initialize it to 50

5. Create a persistent state variable of type U64 called Bit64UnsignedInteger and initialize it to 20

6. Create a persistent state variable of type U256 called Bit256UnsignedInteger and initialize it to 50

### Note

You can't start a variable name with a number
