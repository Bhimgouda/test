1. What happens when we try to update
an item that is out of bounds in an
array (some error or gets passed)

in solidity it passes if we explicitly don't add a require

2. what happens in
    state persistent:
        items []String

    mutate items <- List.State.items:
    does it come to memory, if yes
    then how does it revert back the
    value(seems like solidity storage variable)


    observe items <- List.State.items:
        I feel like this definitely comes to memory under
        the context
